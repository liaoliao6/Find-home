### XP Core Value Journal:

#### Respect(Baijun Jiang)<br>
Before demo, as we tested our application on the cloud, we found out that our search functionality was not performing as it should be. After debugging it for a quite while, we found out that the issue was the library we used in the code was not compatible for python3.8, and as the time was running out. I jumped in and fixed the problem by converting the library to a similar one which supports python3.8. I later then explained the situation to the owner of that functionality,  out of respect he thanked me for fixing the issue.<br>

#### Feedback(Yuxin Zhou)<br>
We provided feedback for each otherâ€™s final version work, and kept working on improving our own design, such as better user experience and frontend-backend-database integration.<br>

#### Courage(Jingjing Bu)<br>
As the demo approached, we found big problems two days before the demo, we told each other to be patient and calm down, and solved the problem  the night before the demo. Bravo!<br>

#### Communication(Haoyang Liu)<br>
Communication is always very important when there are big problems before the deadline. We walked through every detail and everyone gave their valuable thoughts, finally we found out the problem and had the job done.<br>
