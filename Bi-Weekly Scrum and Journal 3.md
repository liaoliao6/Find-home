### XP Core Value Journal:

#### Respect(Baijun Jiang)<br>
In working on the role based authentication, we found that having to approve buyer and renter to use the application is odd. We then had a meeting regarding this issue, and everyone pitched in the ideas of how to resolve it. In the end out of respect, we finalized on how we want to proceed. We decided to give the buyer and retner a new status “Available” which indicates that they can use the application after they register, and only the realtors and sellers need to be verified by the admin users.<br>

#### Feedback(Yuxin Zhou)<br>
We had our bi-weekly meeting and discussed some issues that we each encountered. We provided technical support for each other and improved our design to help other teammates work with their components better.<br>

#### Courage(Jingjing Bu)<br>
As we worked more, we just found more problems, which are interconnected. Sometimes, resolving one problem brought more problems. We encourage each other and communicate, and resolve the problems together.


#### Communication(Haoyang Liu)<br>
We communicated with each other on how we should proceed on improving our UI design and we all agreed to use a card design for result display, and make the application form a part of the property component.<br>
