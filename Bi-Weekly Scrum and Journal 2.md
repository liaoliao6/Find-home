### XP Core Value Journal:

#### Respect(Baijun Jiang)<br>
As the project progressed on, one thing we found out we needed is a cdn for saving user upload images. I have experience of using AWS S3 and CloudFront, and I naturally would want to use the stacks I’m familiar with. However, other team members have knowledge on Flickr. Out of respect, I decided to choose something they are familiar with the most and moved forward.<br>

####  Feedback(Yuxin Zhou)
We had our meeting and everyone provided feedback on topics such as schema design and state control. We reached a consensus on redesigning some schemas and restricted the data types of certain attributes so that components could be rendered properly. We also agreed to use query string information to render certain pages.<br>


#### Courage(Jingjing Bu):
Lots of bugs on UI, on the functionality, however, we discussed the problems with our teammates, and helped each other, and encouraged each other.<br>


#### Communication(Haoyang Liu)
We communicated with each other on how to write property routes for frontend components, so that routing would follow the same format.<br>
