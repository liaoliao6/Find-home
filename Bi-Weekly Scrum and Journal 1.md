Discalmer: We decided to use bi-weekly form as we all have multiple classes' projects to work on. One week of time isn't enough for us to make report, therefore we chose our scrum meeting in bi-weekly fashion.

### XP Core Value Journal:

#### Respect(Baijun Jiang)<br>
In our first bi-weekly meeting, we started by introducing each other’s background and technologies which each person is familiar with. Out of mutual respect, we finalized on the technology stacks we wanted to use on this project. Some of the teammates are not familiar with the stacks we chose but they understood and respected the decision of why we selected those technology stacks.<br>

#### Feedback(Yuxin Zhou)<br>
We had our biweekly meeting and everyone provided feedback on topics such as schema design, technical stack and role authentication.<br>

#### Courage(JingJing Bu)<br>
Some of the team members are not familiar with React, but we’re willing to overcome the difficulties and read lots of documentation.<br>


#### Communication(Haoyang Liu)
Communication: The first week is the time that we get to know our teammate, and discuss how to distribute the workload, have each one to find their best role in the team work and get the best output.<br>
